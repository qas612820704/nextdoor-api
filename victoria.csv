post_17592218365302,Hello friends!!,"Today I'm celebrating the START of SUMMER and have a treat for you!!
Ever since I qualified as a Personal Trainer, I've been totally committed to help the people of London Victoria achieve confidence in the gym and a solid structure with their routine in order to achieve sustainable results with both their mind and body!
It's so common that people struggle with feeling intimidated in the gym and not know what to do to get them from A to B. 
And I want to help.
To celebrate the start of summer I wanted to do something INCREDIBLE and do a giveaway for you lovely people.
My Goal Aims are:
1. I want to help 10 working women achieve confidence in the gym so that they can go on to change their body composition and go forwards with a sustainable routine!
2. I want to educate you about body recomposition 
3. I want to show you how to use your time in the gym efficiently in order to see the changes in your body YOU WANT!
So what‚Äôs the catch? There is no catch.
I'm simply trying to promote awareness of my business in the local area by doing something for free for the community and if it's good, I hope you'll offer a review and perhaps tell your friends and family about me!
But of course, if you'd like to hear more about my Personal Training services, all you have to do is ask!
If this sounds good and you'd like the full details, comment ""ME"" on this post and I'll reach out personally to you or drop me a private message!
PS. I only have space for 10 sessions in my diary!
PPS. I'm closing this giveaway on FRIDAY 2 JUNE!",,L. H.,2023-05-29T09:19:01.809Z,victoria

I don't discount that the council will now waste even more money trying to implement it another way after blowing a small fortune in lawyers and consulting fees,  but for now at least they aren't going to waste millions on a scheme that produces minimal benefit and when the other monstrosity they approved,  the Wilton Road huge building starts construction there is no way the area would work at all for traffic.
