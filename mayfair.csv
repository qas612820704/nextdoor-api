post_17592217334348,"Hi all, on behalf of local residents, we‚Äôve raised a petition asking Westminster City Council to sanction the use of the lovely yet under-utilised Paddington Street Gardens North in Marylebone as an official dog park, thus giving the community a","much-needed venue where our four-legged friends can exercise and socialise with other dogs and humans alike.

This will come at little to no cost to the Council, while delivering countless benefits in terms of community cohesion, animal welfare, mental health and neighbourhood appeal.

You can read more about the area and the benefits this change would bring by clicking here: https://tinyurl.com/2hmrextk
