post_17592217510105,From Andy Metcalf -A New Voice for Kenilworth StJohn’s,"In the run up to the local elections this week on Thursday May 4th Andy Metcalf looks at the important local issues especially in Kenilworth. Andy worked for many years in company and project management, and is now semi-retired, working locally in social care.

I previously set out some of the real issues in Warwick District and the Kenilworth-St John’s area. I now want to highlight two local issues that are affecting everyone. 

•  The cost-of-living crisis, what we are doing about it and how we can support the vulnerable and help local businesses thrive.

•	The fears that have been raised about the future Local Plan. 

These and the other issues I have written about previously are your main concerns that have led me stand as a Conservative candidate for both Warwick District Council and Kenilworth Town Council in the Local elections in Kenilworth St John’s on May 4th.

Working in social care the cost-of-living crisis is of particular concern to me. It is a real problem for most people regardless of where they live. When I talk to people locally despite the war in the Ukraine and the subsequent effect it has had on energy prices and prices generally right across the world, not just here in the UK, they lay the blame on our national Conservative Government. Some people have also expressed their criticism of the changes in government leadership that we have been through recently. I think that yes, it is true that the changes at the top of government and some of the decisions made did cause a loss of confidence in Britain in the international money markets which affected the rate of inflation. However, confidence has been restored by the measures introduced by the new Conservative chancellor Jeremy Hunt and in April this year “British businesses reported their busiest month in a year and consumers turned more confident, according to surveys published that added to signs of a recovery in the economy that has so far defied forecasts of a recession. (Reuters) To help our local businesses I support bringing back free one hour parking in Kenilworth.

We tend to underestimate what the government has done to help everyone meet the rising cost of living. Back in 2022 the Conservative government set up the ‘Energy Bills Support Scheme’ (EBSS) and we got a £400 discount to help with our energy bills over winter 2022 to 2023. There is different help if you live off-grid. But because I think this is paid directly to the energy companies who are reducing our bills, we tend to disregard the amount of help the government is actually providing. The present Conservative government is also delivering the biggest net cut to personal taxes in over a quarter of a century. 

There has also been an extensive ‘Cost of Living Payment scheme’ for the disabled and those on benefits. In addition, from 25th April over eight million families on means-tested benefits will receive the first of three Cost of Living Payments totalling £900 and a £300 payment on top of Winter Fuel Payments for pensioners at the end of 2023. If eligible you do not have to apply-payment is automatic. Do not respond to online scammers pretending to be from the DWP who ask for your bank details.  

Labour, Lib Democrats and the Green Party keep going on about imposing a windfall tax on energy companies – the fact is this has already from the start been imposed by the government. It has been reported that energy companies are now paying 80% in tax which is financing these ‘Cost of Living Payments.’ Taxing them even more would restrict their investment in the provision of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power which they are heavily investing in and providing for the future.  

In Warwickshire extra help is available from the WCC Local welfare Scheme to support people living in the county who are finding it difficult to meet living costs. To apply call 0800 4081448 or 01926 359182 to speak to an advisor in confidence. More info is online at www.warwickshire.gov.uk/localwelfarescheme .           

It is because of this cost-of-living crisis that we are all experiencing whatever our circumstances that Conservative led Warwick District council have FROZEN COUNCIL TAX. This week a resident complained to me that council tax had gone up, and I had to explain that the Kenilworth Town Council tax has risen by 10% decided by the Green party and Liberal Democrats who are now in the majority on KTC.  Conservatives had proposed a 0% increase. But on Warwick District Council Conservatives have frozen any tax increase this year. 

The other main issue that residents have spoken to me about their fears over is the next ‘South Warwickshire Local Plan’ which is due to start in 2027. Recently Warwick District Council launched what is described as a ‘Call for sites’ which is an exercise where council officials ask local land owners for suggestions for possible sites where new houses could be built. To my mind the concept of doing this in this way is wrong and leads to all sorts of problems. It encourages land owners the potential opportunity (if sites are purchased by the council or developers) to make money. The sites offered may no longer be required by the owners, but often no thought has been given to how new housing on those sites will affect both the environment and nearby residents. In some cases, the owners do not live in the area or even in this country so the impact of new housing estates would not in any way actually affect them. Another big disadvantage of this way of finding sites is that the process takes many months and years to complete, in the meanwhile everyone living in the surrounding area to the suggested sites lives in fear of having houses built on their doorstep, losing perhaps their views or access to open countryside and often experiencing a drop in value of their own properties as a result. This is the situation happening now because in Kenilworth St John’s area a very large housing development is proposed on Green belt land at Oak’s Farm off Rouncil Lane.

In response to this I can say that I and local Conservatives are totally against this proposal. Conservative Councillor Richard Hales said recently “To be really clear, Kenilworth will have enough homes built once the current local plan has been fully implemented. Furthermore, we commit to fight alongside residents through the local planning stage, should any attempts be made to bring forward new housing developments in our already depleted green belt surrounding Kenilworth.” 

The Liberal Democrats have taken a soft approach to this issue, attacking instead the national Conservative government. Our local Conservative position is quite clear- NO MORE BUILDING ON OUR GREEN BELT.    

If you want a forward-looking council that improves our environment and enhances our way of life locally vote Conservative on May 4th.

post_17592217293302,From Andy Metcalf - A New Voice for Kenilworth St John’s,"In the run up to the local elections on May 4th Andy Metcalf takes a look at some of the local issues especially in Kenilworth. Andy worked for many years in company and project management, and is now semi-retired, working locally in social care.

I previously set out some of the real issues in Warwick District and the Kenilworth-St John’s area- our environment and Local Conservatives commitment to Net Zero, HS2, the new Kenilworth School and Castle Farm leisure Centre. I want to now highlight some of the other local issues and concerns. Concerns have led me stand as a Conservative candidate for both Warwick District Council and Kenilworth Town Council in the Local elections in Kenilworth St John’s on May 4th.

Well, it is not just me that is concerned because Local Conservatives carried out a survey in Kenilworth St John’s to find out exactly what residents were saying. Some of the other issues raised were about -the new waste and re-cycling service, local health and NHS services, pot-holes in our roads, policing and crime.

Firstly, on the new joint Warwick District Council (WDC) and Stratford District Council’s (SDC) waste and recycling collection service. A merger of WDC and SDC was proposed last year which did not in the event go ahead and there was criticism that considering a merger had been a waste of time and money. However, a Conservative initiative was to merge some services including the waste and recycling collection service to make it more efficient and will save council tax payers money. This has been introduced and yes, there have been and continues to be some teething problems, but overall this has been very successful. As reported in the Leamington Courier there has been a big increase in recycled rubbish (in September 22 it had risen six percent more than the previous year) and is expected to rise even more this year, as is the amount of food waste collected. New figures released from the council show that less rubbish is now going to landfill. Also, the new WDC app which alerts you on smartphones as to which bins to put out when works very well. 

Local health services are a concern to many, with the experience of having to speak to a doctor on the phone in order to be assessed as to whether you need to go to the surgery. It was almost impossible to actually see a doctor during Covid but now thankfully the situation has improved. The local NHS health service is not something that Warwick District Council is responsible for, but Conservative Councillors are in touch with and do liaise with Warwickshire County Council and the South Warwickshire University NHS Foundation Trust on the provision of public health services. As Local Conservatives we are campaigning for a new Health Centre in addition to the two existing ones in Kenilworth.

On potholes in our roads this has been made much worse this year because of the extremes of weather we are now having. Potholes in our roads are extremely dangerous especially for cyclists, but they also cause much damage to cars. In the Chancellors Spring Budget, he announced that additional money would be available in the highways and pothole repair fund. For Warwickshire this means an additional £2.874 million will be available but repairs do depend on highway faults or potholes being reported to Warwickshire County Council which can be done online at https://www.warwickshire.gov.uk/reporthighwayproblem 

Policing and crime is a matter for our local police force but this is overseen by Warwickshire’s Conservative police and crime commissioner Phillip Secombe. Police numbers and resources have nationally faced cuts over the past decade but Warwickshire police have recently recruited and say they now have the largest number of officers in its more than 160-year history. Each area of the county will have a Patrol Investigations Unit, with responsibility for investigating many of the crimes that do not meet the threshold for CID investigation such as assaults, burglaries and domestic abuse. Residents often tell me they would like to see more officers on the streets but as there is now a high percentage of fraud and online crime this affects how many officers are visible to us on a day-to-day basis. To get in touch with our police and crime commissioner contact www.philipseccombe.co.uk 

Speeding is a problem on many of our roads. On my road cars are exceeding the limit every day and a car was recently recorded at travelling at 69mph on a 30mph (and 20mph section by a school) limit. The answer to this I believe is to install on main routes average speed cameras which work on numberplate recognition. They are currently installing these on roads in Coventry.

In my next issue before the local elections on May 4th I will be writing about the issue that is affecting everyone -the cost-of-living crisis, what we are doing about it and how we can support the vulnerable and help local businesses thrive. Also on the fears that have been raised about the future Local Plan – I will just say now that  Conservatives are against building any more houses on green belt land! 

If you want a forward-looking council that improves our environment and enhances our way of life locally vote Conservative on May 4th.

post_17592216805988,From Andy Metcalf A New Voice for Kenilworth St John's,"In the run up to the local elections on May 4th Andy Metcalf takes a look at some of the local issues especially in Kenilworth. Andy worked for many years in company and project management, and is now semi-retired, working locally in social care.

Having greatly appreciated living in Kenilworth in Warwick District over the past 30 plus years I have become increasingly concerned how the focus and decisions by local councillors are not meeting mine and other resident’s needs. All local councillors are elected to represent residents on local issues, but councillors representing wards in Kenilworth are predominately from the Green Party and the Liberal Democrats and, I believe, are letting the residents of Kenilworth down. 

For this reason I am standing as a Conservative candidate for both Warwick District Council and Kenilworth Town Council in the Local elections in Kenilworth St John’s  on May 4th. - What you say- Conservative! -haven’t they been in control for years? Well Conservatives may hold the majority at WCC and through partnerships with others lead WDC , but many people don’t realise that of twenty nine Councillor roles across Town, District and County levels Conservatives hold just eight . Nine are held by the Liberal Democrats Green party and twelve by the Green Party and they are letting residents down by their constant indecision and abstaining to vote for sensible proposals. This is because they have a limited agenda and outlook which is mainly focused on environmental issues. 

But no one party has a monopoly on environmental ideas or action. Local Conservatives are doing more than just talk about climate change, we are committed to the district Net Zero target by- encouraging cycling by funding the new K2L cycleway and others in Kenilworth, planting trees (over 250 since 2017) changing council fleet vehicles to electric, installing more electric charging points across the district and building Net Zero social housing. We are also freezing council tax -real actions that affect our way of life both now and in the future.
Over the next few weeks before the local elections on May 4th I want to highlight some of these real local issues which affect our way of life starting with HS2, the new Kenilworth School and the new leisure facilities in Kenilworth. 

Firstly HS2. I think we are all upset about the amount of disruption and changing of the landscape that HS2 has brought to our region. But although we didn’t want it the view that local Conservatives have taken is rather than spending time and effort on objecting to something that is ongoing, is to lobby the government and influence the contractors to mitigate and soften the effect of HS2 on local residents.  Our Conservative MP Jeremy Wright lobbied hard for a new modern facility to replace the old village hall – and the new Burton Green Community Centre has now been built and completed. 
Should it be cancelled? -I would say it is too late now, the damage has been done to the countryside also I think there is a lesson to be learnt from the Channel Tunnel which as you may remember was started and then cancelled – to cancel it, once started, cost in today’s valuation billions of pounds. When it was started again and completed years later it cost many more billions of pounds as a result of the delay.  

However, a much more positive project locally is the building of the new purpose-built Kenilworth School off Glasshouse Lane in Kenilworth. In many areas of the country there is a lack of secondary school places resulting in children having to travel often large distances each day to get to school. Here the Conservative led Warwick District Council have championed bringing the new school to Kenilworth which will actually be the largest secondary school in England. But unbelievably Kenilworth Town Council, where the Green Party and Liberal democrats have a majority decided to object to the planning application. However due to Conservative WDC councillors it went ahead and the new Kenilworth School and sixth form building is well underway.      

Another project which Kenilworth’s Conservatives have championed is the £20M pounds investment in Kenilworth’s new leisure facilities. Again, the Green Party and Liberal Democrats campaigned against the new swimming pools but when the planning application was submitted neither voted against it. Both the Leisure Centre with sports hall, 80 station gym and fitness studios at Castle Farm and the new pools with adjoining sun terrace in Abbey fields are now underway, but as you may know the work in Abbey Fields has been delayed due to the archaeological finds on the site.  

If you want a forward-looking council that improves our environment and enhances our way of life locally vote Conservative on May 4th.

post_17592214362322,"Hi,","Sadly, one of my bunny rabbits passed away recently. It’s been very heartbreaking for us as a family but even more sad for my other bunny - his name is Bear. 

Bear is now left with no partner/pair and we really do not wish to replace the bunny we lost with another. 

I have selfishly thought about just keeping Bear with us on his own and giving him lots of human contact but after gaining lots of advice, I now know that this is not the best idea for him. 

He is a beautiful grey and white, almost 3 year old, neutered male. If anyone knows of any bunny lovers who would be happy to take on our Bear so that he can have a friend again, please could you get in touch. 

All of the rescue homes are full.
